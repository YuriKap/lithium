 <p>Welcome to Pet Talk Place. We’re excited to have this community
space to share with all of you. The mission of this community is
to provide a space for pet owners to share their stories, voice
concerns, network with other pet owners, exchange
ideas/tips/information, and seek expert advice from valued Petco
associates. </p>
<p>To keep the community productive and usable for all members, it
is important that users follow our user guidelines outlined below.
</p>
<h2>User Guidelines:</h2>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>1. Be respectful and courteous</h3>
<p>We want you, and all members, to feel comfortable sharing
thoughts and ideas. While we understand that pet discussions
can stir up a wide range of passions and feelings, we ask that
you keep your tone positive and your comments constructive. It
never hurts to let that well-thought-out rebuttal, simmer for
a few minutes before you hit submit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>2. Be relevant and stay on topic</h3>
<p>Make sure your contributions are relevant to the mission of
the community and to the specific forum or blog where you
post. For instance, if you have a question about dog parks,
please make sure you post it in the Dog forum. Believe it or
not, people in the Cat forum are not likely to have the
answers you seek. </p>
<p>If you have a new question, start a new thread rather than
interrupting a conversation. Having said that, it doesn’t hurt
to search the community to see if another member has already
posed the same question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>3. Keep your word</h3>
<p>If you make a promise, or enter a contract with another
member, be sure you are in a position to honor that promise or
contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>4. Respect and protect privacy</h3>
<p>Don’t share anything you wouldn’t want blasted across the
internet. We strongly advise against posting personal
information (either yours or anyone else’s). It’s okay to
share your first name, and even your last name if you are so
bold, but avoid sharing: your date of birth, email address,
social security number, or any other information that can be
used to exploit your well-being. </p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>5. Use good judgment</h3>
<p>Remember, not all advice is sound advice. While members and
associates will do their best to help each other out, it is
entirely possible for the advice you receive to be wrong or
incomplete. Always apply good judgment and remember that in
some instances it will be best to seek professional advice
from your veterinarian.</p>
</li>
